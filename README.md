The goal of the project is to create a Text-to-MongoDB Query Agent - a system that:
- Takes a natural language query from the user.
- Uses an LLM (Large Language Model) to translate it into MongoDB Query Language (MQL).
- Executes the query against a live MongoDB database.
- Returns the results in a structured or conversational format.
- This bridges the gap between human language and database operations, allowing anyone - technical or not - to interact with complex datasets conversationally.
